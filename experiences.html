<p>We will be hosting 3 types of fishing casting, fly fishing, and noodling. If you have a different 
    technique feel free to use it of course.

    Most people that are familiar with fishing would question why we allow noodling but it is legal 
    to do so in the state of Georgia between the months of March and July with the proper license of 
    course.<br></p>

                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Casting, we all know what casting is it's when you use a rod and cast out bait into a body of water. 
                    Generally speaking, casting is the easiest way to fish either on land or on a boat in the middle of 
                    a lake. It's both calming and relaxing if you don't mind sitting in silence waiting for a bite. 
                    Though some people may not have the patience for it, it's still a nice hobby to take part in 
                    especially when you're out camping.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Fly Fishing</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Fly fishing is very similar to casting the only real difference is that the rod used for the act 
                    is extremely long. It's made out of a completely different kind of wood compared to a normal fishing 
                    rod. When fly fishing you must stay on high alert since the vibrations of a fish biting is a 
                    distance away from where you're standing.</p>
                </div>
                
                <button class="accordion">Noodling</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Noodling is a whole other different category of fishing. That is because instead of using a 
                    fishing rod you use your hands. This is generally done in freshwater but people near saltwater can 
                    do this too if a fish is up close to the shore. The people around freshwater though usually only do 
                    this to catch catfish and it is illegal in most states but that won't stop people from noodling.</p>
