                <br>Greetings and welcome.<br><br>

This website came into existence because of my slight interest in fishing. It's a pretty cool sport 
and hobby. Unfortunately, I have no experience when it comes to fishing so I planned a trip out to 
Indian Springs State Park to practice.<br><br>

I invite you and anyone else interested in this camping adventure up north. It'll span for a week in 
the month of April of next year.<br><br>

Even if there's just a small group of people going out with me during that time to have our fishing 
trip it'll still be a grand experience. I can't wait to catch and release some or maybe cook some up. 
It might even feel like a true camping adventure then.<br><br>

We'll try to catch any native fish in the area if possible and the fishing won't stop when the sun goes 
down. I heard some fish only swim at night so that'll be more fun to be hand but we'll take breaks we 
do have a week to figure out the basics and actually get to fishing so no rush!<br><br>
